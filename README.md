Change point detection is a critical task in statistical analysis, where the goal is
to identify times when the probability distribution of a stochastic process or time
series changes. The Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) model is a prominent approach for detecting such change points due to its computational efficiency and
exactness. However, the performance of PELT is highly dependent on the correct
calibration of its penalty parameter, which is often a non-trivial task. Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
interpreting complex data from both visual and textual domains. This research proposes the novel integration of VLMs to automate the evaluation and tuning of
the PELT modelâ€™s parameters. We investigate the potential of VLMs to provide
feedback and interpretation that can enhance the accuracy and reliability of PELT
segmentation. To illustrate the practicality of this approach, we analyze publication trends over time within the arXiv repository as a case study. Our findings
suggest that VLMs can effectively assess the performance of PELT and may be
generalized to other signal processing and machine learning applications. This
represents a significant step forward in the field of automated model evaluation,
with implications for a wide range of data-driven disciplines.
